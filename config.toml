observability = """
The term [**observability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability) stems from the discipline of [control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory) and refers to how well a system can be understood on the basis of the **telemetry** that it produces.

In software, observability typically refers to telemetry produced by **services** and is divided into three major verticals:

* [**Tracing**](https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/what-is-tracing) 
* [**Metrics**](https://opencensus.io/stats)
* **Logging**

OpenTelemetry is an effort to combine all three verticals into a *single system*. It replaces the [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io) project, which focused exclusively on tracing, and the [OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io) project, which focused on tracing and metrics.

Intially, OpenTelemetry will not support logging
